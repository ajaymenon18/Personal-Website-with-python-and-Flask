In the above mini project a Desktop UI is created using tkinter library. The UI is a book information storage and display system. It allows user to enter the details of a new book, create new records, access the record and then save it in the record. In the current iteration the information is stored in the db file and future versions will be having the data retreieved from a database system. 

The project contains both front end and backend sections and in the backend section relies on the sqlite3 and object orientation is implemented in the backend and in the frontend of the UI development tkinter library is used extensivly
